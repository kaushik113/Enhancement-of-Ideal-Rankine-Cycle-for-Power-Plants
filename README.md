# Enhancement of Ideal Rankine Cycle for Power Plants

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of power plants by modifying the conventional Rankine cycle. The primary objectives were to:
- Increase thermal efficiency beyond the current benchmark of 41%.
- Achieve steam quality above 85%.
- Adhere to specific constraints: boiler pressure fixed at 15 MPa, condenser pressure at 10 kPa, and a turbine inlet temperature capped at 500Â°C.

## Key Features
- **Cycle Modifications:** Advanced techniques such as reheating and feedwater heating were employed to improve both thermal efficiency and steam quality.
- **Tools and Analysis:** Cantera and MATLAB were utilized for detailed thermodynamic analysis, resulting in a thermal efficiency of 47.45% and a steam quality of 90.42%.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying boiler pressure (12 MPa to 15 MPa) and condenser pressure (5 kPa to 10 kPa). The impact on cycle efficiency and net work output was visualized using MATLAB plots.

This project successfully met and exceeded the performance targets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed cycle modifications and optimizing the Rankine cycle for improved power plant efficiency.

## Team Contributions
As part of a five-member team, I focused on the research and optimization of the Rankine cycle. My responsibilities also included performance analysis using MATLAB. Meanwhile, my teammates contributed to the report writing and diagram creation, ensuring that the project documentation was detailed and visually compelling, effectively complementing the technical analysis.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Atul Bhargav and Professor Kaustabh Rane for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. His expertise in thermodynamics played a pivotal role in the successful enhancement of the Rankine cycle's efficiency.
